A data entry clerk is a member of staff employed to 
enter or update data into a computer system.
Data is often entered into a computer from paper documents using a keyboard. 
The keyboards used can often have special keys and 
multiple colors to help in the task and speed up the work. 
Proper ergonomics at the workstation is a common topic considered. 
The Data Entry Clerk may also use a mouse, and a manually-fed 
scanner may be involved. Speed and accuracy, not necessarily in that 
order, are the key measures of the job; it is possible to do this job 
from home.
