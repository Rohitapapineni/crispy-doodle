WA late 20th century trend in typing,
primarily used with devices with small keyboards
(such as PDAs and Smartphones), is thumbing or thumb typing.
This can be accomplished using one or both thumbs. 
Similar to desktop keyboards and input devices, 
if a user overuses keys which need hard presses and/or 
have small and unergonomic layouts, 
it could cause thumb tendonitis or other repetitive strain injury.
