In 1903, they built a motor and propeller for their glider. 
Orville made the first flight, which lasted 12 seconds, and flew 120 feet. 
Wilbur's flight was 852 feet in 59 seconds. 
These first flights in 1903 were just the start of the evolution of planes.
By the year 1909, Bleriot had crossed the English Channel. 
By the year 1912, a two-piece plywood fuselage was built for greater strength.
